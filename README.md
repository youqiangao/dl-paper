+ keyword: fisher consistency, multicategory hinge loss, multicategory support vector machine
+ summary: discuss four multi-class hinge loss, only loss (b) are always fisher concsistent. Adding a constraint to loss (a), loss (c) and truncating loss (d)  make them fisher consistent.

* summary: propose a LDA eigenvalue-based objective function and encode x through a deep neural nework f(.) to push the net to generate discriminative hidden representation H.
